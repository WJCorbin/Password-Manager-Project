# Password-Manager-Project
This is a simple basic password manager that can generate passwords and saves the passwords to a text file

Looking to build on it to make it encrypted and accessible from a website or mobile app

Updated to use a JSON file instead

Added a search feature

Will be switching to a csv and adding encryption in the near future
